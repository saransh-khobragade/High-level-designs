# Live Streaming — Updated Design

> A cleaned-up, interview-ready high-level design for a live video streaming pipeline with improvements: origin server, load balancing, monitoring, DRM, and low-latency options.

## Visual overview (conceptual)

```
Broadcaster Client (RTMP / SRT)
  ↓
Load Balancer / Edge Ingest Nodes (regional)
  ↓
Segmentation Service (chunker)  <--- Health & Preview API
  ↓
Kafka (ingest topic)  →  Encoding Job Coordinator
  ↓                       ↓         ↓         ↓
Encoding Workers (multi-bitrate) W1 W2 W3 …
  ↓
Distributed File Store (S3 / DFS)  ← Encoding output
  ↓
Packaging Service (HLS/DASH, CMAF, Chunked) → Origin Server
  ↓
Origin Server (manifest control, auth, cache control)
  ↓
CDN (pull caches; global delivery)
  ↓
Viewer Clients (adaptive playback)

Notifications / Control Plane: Packaging → Pub/Sub / WebSocket → Dashboard / Clients
Monitoring & Metrics: Metrics pipeline → Prometheus / Grafana / Alerting
Auth & DRM: Token Service + DRM Key Server integrated at Origin/Packaging
```

## Key components & responsibilities

* **Edge Ingest / Load Balancer**: Accepts RTMP/SRT from broadcaster; terminates protocol and forwards to regional segmentation. Provides TLS termination and basic auth/ingest tokens.

* **Segmentation Service**: Converts incoming stream into small GOP-aligned segments or CMAF chunks; extracts metadata, pushes segment references to Kafka and stores raw segments (if needed) in temporary storage.

* **Kafka (Message Queue)**: Decouples ingest/segmentation from encoding and packaging. Topic(s): `ingest-segments`, `encoding-complete`, `packaging-jobs`.

* **Encoding Workers**: Stateless workers that pull jobs and transcode into multiple renditions (ABR ladder). Autoscale based on queue length. Retry & dead-letter topics for failed jobs.

* **Distributed File Store (DFS / S3)**: Durable storage for encoded segments and manifests. Prefer object store with lifecycle policies.

* **Packaging Service**: Reads encoded segments, creates HLS/DASH manifests or CMAF chunk playlists, signs manifests if needed, and writes final artifacts to Origin/DFS. Responsible for low-latency packaging (chunked transfer) if configured.

* **Origin Server**: Acts as source of truth. Serves manifests and segment URLs to CDN. Handles authentication tokens, DRM license distribution (redirects to DRM server), cache-control headers, and range requests.

* **CDN**: Pulls content from Origin, caches segments and manifests. Use CDN with support for instant cache invalidation or origin failover.

* **Notification System (Pub/Sub / WebSocket)**: Notifies producer dashboards and viewers about stream health, availability, or transcoding completion.

* **Monitoring & Observability**: Collect latency, encode times, queue depth, error rates. Use Prometheus/Grafana and centralized logging (ELK/Opensearch).

* **Auth & DRM**: Short-lived ingest tokens, signed manifest URLs, playback tokens, and DRM key server integration for secure streams.

## Data flow details

1. **Ingest**: Broadcaster → Edge Ingest → Segmentation. Segmentation writes segment metadata to Kafka and optionally temp storage.
2. **Transcode**: Encoding workers consume Kafka messages, transcode, upload outputs to DFS, then emit `encoding-complete` with rendition metadata.
3. **Package**: Packaging Service consumes `encoding-complete`, builds manifests (HLS/DASH/CMAF), writes to Origin and notifies CDN (optionally via CDN API or rely on CDN pull).
4. **Serve**: Clients request manifests from CDN. CDN fetches from Origin on cache-miss. Clients play ABR variant.
5. **Notify**: Notifications published for UI and watchers (e.g., stream live, encoding errors).

---

## Low-latency options

* **CMAF + chunked transfer (HTTP/1.1 chunked or HTTP/2)**: Reduce latency below HLS segment durations.
* **WebRTC**: For sub-second latency use-cases (e.g., auctions, interactive); more complex and stateful.
* **Reduced segment durations** (1s chunks) + aggressive packaging and CDN with low TTL.

---

## Scalability & Resilience patterns

* **Autoscaling**: Scale encoding workers by Kafka consumer lag and CPU/GPU utilization.
* **Geographic edge ingest**: Reduce round-trip time for broadcasters worldwide.
* **Retry + Dead-letter queues**: For failed transcodes and packaging jobs.
* **Multi-origin & CDN failover**: Use active-passive origins for resilience.
* **Backpressure**: If packaging/origin falls behind, apply backpressure to encoding queue or degrade to lower bitrates.

---

## Security and Access Control

* **Ingest tokens** for broadcasters (short-lived JWTs).
* **Signed manifest URLs / playback tokens** for viewers.
* **DRM (Widevine/PlayReady/FairPlay)** for premium content; integrate with License Server.
* **Rate limiting** and IP whitelisting on ingest endpoints.

---

## Operational considerations

* **Cost**: Encoding is expensive — consider using spot GPU capacity or pre-warmed instances for big events.
* **SLA**: Define acceptable end-to-end latency and error budgets.
* **Testing**: Chaos test encoding failures, origin downtime, and CDN cache misses.
* **Observability**: Provide per-stream dashboards with segment latency, encode time, and viewer metrics.

---

## Failures & recovery

* If an encoding worker fails: job re-queued; dead-letter after N attempts → alert.
* If DFS temporarily unavailable: packaging retries with exponential backoff; maintain short-lived local cache.
* If origin overloaded: use read-replicas or autoscale origin; CDN fallback to cached content.

---

## Example ABR ladder (practical)

* 2160p — 16 Mbps
* 1080p — 6 Mbps
* 720p — 3.5 Mbps
* 480p — 1.2 Mbps
* 240p — 400 kbps

Tune based on event and audience bandwidth distribution.

* produce a **clean PNG diagram** of this architecture, or
* generate an **interview cheat-sheet** (1-page) describing each component and likely interview questions.
